# Themes

AngelHacks is dedicated to giving back to the community—and we do that in part by encouraging students to make projects that do exactly that! We'll be giving 3 prizes to each category on top of the general prize -- that means, even if you don't win the overall prize, you can still get a cool award just by winning a category!

## Environment

Make something that helps the environment. It may seem like a hard thing, but remember, the small things count! Ship projects that count someone's carbon emissions, or tell you the truth about each state's pollution regulations. Be creative -- what does the environment mean to you? It doesn't have to be just the greenery, it could be how other people interact, or how the people around you behave.

## Education

A major goal of AngelHacks is to improve education—especially in computer science. Your project can help achieve this goal! Make a project that encourages students to make a mini-site, help teachers grade homework, create an online notes sharing pod, and more! We want you make a feasible project that can have a real impact on the community and beyond.

# We’re driven by a mission.

AngelHacks is dedicated in encourage students to learn computer science—at just the age where they're interested in technology and programming.

100+ students of all skill levels will assemble for a weekend of collaboration and innovation, each building apps/websites/games that give back to the community in 12 hours. Then participants and judges will select the winning projects and teams.

# Coding is a superpower.

Starting to code has a lasting impact. Once you begin coding, you switch from being a consumer to being a creator. We want to make everyone a creator—it’s a magical transformation. You can solve problems your way, bounded only by your imagination.

We know this because we’re the leaders of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) at Ad Astra School, where we have good infrastructure for students to learn to code. Now, we want to bring that experience to everyone. This is a hackathon by the students, for the students, and for the future of all of Los Angeles.
